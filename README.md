# Fallen London Silly Names
*An incredibly silly and pointless userscript that has not been endorsed by anybody.*

(insert a bad screenshot here)

## Preface
You may ask yourself, "Hey, Gwyn? What the ████?" And you'd be right to do, because i can't adequately explain my motivation for embarking on this endeavour. I had spent the previous two weeks on a thirteen-year-old iMac (8,1) with an installation of Arch while i waited for replacement parts for my desktop after a catestrophic failure.

I can only summarize my state upon returning to my machine, it now working, as "elated", and I promptly decided to try and spin up something absurd in a night.

Also I was chatting with friends and they egged me on, as good friends do. ❤

## What it does
This userscript replaces the icons and tooltip names of various items in [Fallen London](https://fallenlondon.com) with other icons and names. This is a very silly thing to do which primarily is to make some good jokes.

## Requirements
A web browser with something like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to handle userscripts.

## How to install
