# Fallen London Silly Names
*An incredibly silly and pointless userscript that has not been endorsed by anybody.*

**FYI: Currently this script seems to have broken, and i'm likely to not update it any time soon. Sorry if anybody was keen on it!**

![I don't actually remember what i put in here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59987656/119097667-048d0e80-b9e3-11eb-8224-67bc276b553d.png)

## Requirements
This userscript is for the browser game [Fallen London](https://fallenlondon.com). You'll need a web browser with something like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to handle userscripts.

This will potentially cause problems for alt-text and general accessibility. It's a gag thing. And also, it's very glitchy and probably won't work a lot.

You can install the latest version here: [**üìúInstall**](https://raw.github.com/GwyndolynMarchant/Fallen-London-Silly-Names/main/fl-silly-names.user.js)

## Explanation
This userscript replaces the icons and tooltip names of various items in Fallen London with other icons and names. This is a very silly thing to do which primarily is to make some good jokes. So far it works for sure on the possessions page and I doubt anywhere else.

You may ask yourself, "Hey, Gwyn? What the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà?" And you'd be right to do, because i can't adequately explain my motivation for embarking on this endeavour. I had spent the previous two weeks on a thirteen-year-old iMac (8,1) with an installation of Arch while i waited for replacement parts for my desktop after a catestrophic failure.

I can only summarize my state upon returning to my machine, it now working, as "elated", and I promptly decided to try and spin up something absurd in a night.

Also I was chatting with friends and they egged me on, as good friends do. ‚ù§
